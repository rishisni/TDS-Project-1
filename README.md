# Project Overview: Exploring Boston's GitHub Developers

Dive into the vibrant community of Boston-based developers with our comprehensive analysis of GitHub users who have over 100 followers! This project leverages the powerful GitHub API to gather valuable insights into the programming landscape, revealing trends in popular languages and repository practices.

## Key Findings
- **Diverse Programming Landscape**: Our analysis uncovered a fascinating range of programming languages that are popular among developers in Boston, showcasing the city's rich technological ecosystem.
- **Importance of Licensing**: A significant number of repositories were found lacking clear licensing information. We encourage developers to include licenses in their repositories to promote transparency and collaboration.

## Project Structure
- **`users.csv`**: This file provides a snapshot of users, featuring essential details such as username, company affiliation, bio, and follower count.
- **`repositories.csv`**: Here, youâ€™ll find a curated list of the latest repositories for each user, complete with metrics like stars, watchers, and primary programming language.
